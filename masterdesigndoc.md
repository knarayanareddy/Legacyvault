# LegacyVault — masterdesigndoc.md (Single Source of Truth)
**Version:** 1.0 (production-grade end-to-end spec)  
**Date:** 2026-05-04  
**Purpose:** This document is the canonical spec for building LegacyVault as a complete product (protocol + apps + services). It includes: PDAs, Anchor structs, contexts, error codes, events, off-chain architecture, UX, security model, and a full execution plan.

> **Legal/Compliance disclaimer (non-negotiable):** LegacyVault is an automation and custody tool for digital assets. It is **not** legal advice, does not guarantee compliance with any jurisdiction’s estate/probate law, and does not claim to produce legally enforceable wills by itself. Users should consult licensed counsel. Product copy must reflect this.

# 1) Product summary
LegacyVault is a Solana-native “digital estate executor” that lets a user (Owner) create a programmable inheritance plan for their digital assets, backed by an on-chain vault and a multi-party, time-delayed unlock process.

**Core capabilities (full build):**
- Vault-based custody for:
  - SOL
  - SPL tokens (including Token-2022)
  - NFTs (SPL token accounts with supply=1; optionally Metaplex metadata references)
  - “Position tokens” (LP receipt tokens, liquid staking tokens, yield vault shares) as SPL
- Inheritance plan:
  - Beneficiaries + shares (bps)
  - Per-asset rules (optional overrides)
  - Guardians + threshold (M-of-N)
  - Liveness / heartbeat rules (Owner check-ins)
  - Inactivity threshold + timelock delay
  - Optional disputes / arbitration hooks
- Safety features:
  - Owner override / cancel unlock
  - Mandatory timelock after approvals
  - Panic freeze
  - Guardian approval audit trail
- Product features:
  - Encrypted document storage (letters of intent, legal docs) with on-chain hash anchoring
  - Notifications and monitoring (email/SMS/push/Wallet notifications)
  - Professional guardian network (optional) with bonding + reputation
  - Subscription plans (optional) with on-chain renewal state

---

# 2) Product principles & requirements (full build)

## 2.1 Non-negotiable principles
1. **Safety over convenience**: false positives must be reversible and slow; theft must be hard.
2. **Deterministic execution**: distribution rules must be on-chain verifiable and replayable.
3. **Least trust**: off-chain services can assist UX but must not be required to custody or finalize distribution.
4. **Transparency**: every step emits events; indexers reconstruct full audit trails.
5. **Compute-aware**: distributions must be chunked to avoid compute limits.

## 2.2 Full build requirements
### Vault & assets
- Deposit/withdraw SOL and SPL
- Vault ATA per mint (owned by a PDA)
- Maintain an “asset registry” on-chain and/or via PDA discovery

### Estate plan
- Beneficiary list + total shares = 10,000 bps
- Per-beneficiary metadata label
- Per-asset overrides:
  - pro-rata by shares (default)
  - assign entire asset to a single beneficiary
  - “split by fixed bps” per asset (optional)

### Unlock process
- Inactivity-based initiation
- Guardian approvals (M-of-N)
- Timelock delay
- Owner override/cancellation
- Dispute flow with optional arbitration

### Monitoring / liveness
- Owner check-in
- Optional delegated liveness key(s)
- Optional “multi-channel check-in” (wallet signature + email OTP) off-chain to reduce false positives

### Documents
- Client-side encryption of docs
- Store URI off-chain (Arweave/Shadow Drive/S3)
- Store hash + metadata on-chain
- Optional attestation pointer (external attestation program integration)

### Professional guardian network (optional but in-scope for full build)
- Guardian profiles (KYC status off-chain)
- Guardian bond / stake (on-chain escrow)
- Selection by owners
- Reputation events + slashing hooks (requires dispute mechanism)

### Subscription / billing (optional but in-scope)
- On-chain subscription state controls premium features:
  - number of vaults
  - number of guardians
  - professional guardian access
  - advanced notifications
  - doc storage quotas (off-chain enforced)

---

# 3) Actors & trust model

## 3.1 Actors
- **Owner**: creates vault, deposits assets, configures guardians/beneficiaries, checks in.
- **Guardian**: approves unlock when inactivity threshold passed; may be friend/family/lawyer/professional.
- **Beneficiary**: receives distributed assets.
- **Professional Guardian**: registered, bonded guardian offering services for a fee.
- **Arbiter (optional)**: resolves disputes and triggers slashing/cancellation actions.

## 3.2 Trust assumptions
- The protocol assumes the Owner chooses trustworthy guardians (or uses bonded professionals).
- The protocol assumes off-chain notification services can fail; on-chain execution must still be possible.
- The protocol does not assume any centralized service is online for funds to move after vault setup.

---

# 4) End-to-end UX (full build)

## 4.1 Owner UX — onboarding
1. Connect wallet
2. Create Vault:
   - choose heartbeat interval (e.g., 30 days)
   - choose inactivity threshold (e.g., 90 days)
   - choose timelock (e.g., 30 days)
   - choose security options:
     - allow liveness delegates? (Y/N)
     - enable panic freeze? (Y/N)
3. Add beneficiaries:
   - add wallet addresses + share %
   - validate shares sum to 100%
   - optional labels (e.g., “Spouse”, “Sibling”)
4. Add guardians:
   - add addresses OR invite via email to connect wallet
   - choose threshold (e.g., 2-of-3)
   - optional: choose a professional guardian from marketplace
5. Deposit assets:
   - “asset inventory” view with import from wallet
   - deposits SOL/SPL/NFTs into vault
6. Upload documents:
   - letter of intent
   - optional legal doc PDF
   - encrypt client-side, upload, store hash + URI on-chain
7. Activate monitoring:
   - show next check-in date
   - configure notification channels

## 4.2 Owner UX — routine
- “Check in” button (wallet signature)
- View vault health:
  - last check-in
  - inactivity deadline
  - whether any unlock session exists
- Manage:
  - update guardians/beneficiaries
  - add/remove assets
  - withdraw assets (only when safe)
  - update document versions (hash changes)

## 4.3 Guardian UX
- Guardian dashboard:
  - vaults you guard
  - for each: status, last check-in, eligible date for unlock
- When eligible:
  - “Initiate unlock” (creates unlock session)
  - “Approve unlock” (adds approval)
- Guardian transparency:
  - approvals list
  - timelock countdown
  - immutable event trail

## 4.4 Beneficiary UX
- Beneficiary dashboard:
  - vaults where you are beneficiary
  - expected share ranges (estimates)
  - when distribution executed: assets received + receipts (events)

## 4.5 Professional guardian UX
- Create guardian profile
- Undergo KYC (off-chain)
- Bond stake on-chain
- Receive invitations / requests
- Earn fees (off-chain invoicing or on-chain fee split if implemented)

---

# 5) System architecture

## 5.1 On-chain (Anchor program: `legacyvault`)
Single Anchor program (monorepo) with modules:
- vault creation & settings
- beneficiary registry (per-entry PDAs)
- guardian registry (per-entry PDAs)
- asset rules (per-mint PDAs)
- deposits & withdrawals
- liveness check-ins & delegates
- unlock sessions + approvals
- distribution sessions (chunked execution)
- disputes & slashing hooks (optional)
- subscription state (optional)
- professional guardian profiles + bonds (optional)

## 5.2 Off-chain services
1. **API Gateway**
   - auth/session (wallet-based SIWS: “Sign-in with Solana”)
   - vault metadata
   - notifications configuration
   - document upload orchestration
2. **Indexer**
   - listens to program logs/events
   - populates read models (vault status timelines)
3. **Notifier**
   - email/SMS/push
   - guardian invites
   - check-in reminders
   - unlock initiated alerts
4. **Doc Service**
   - encryption happens client-side
   - service provides pre-signed upload URLs + pinning
5. **KYC Provider Adapter** (optional)
   - for professional guardians / institutional plans
6. **Automation Worker**
   - suggests transactions:
     - when vault becomes unlock-eligible
     - batched distribution execution
   - never holds private keys (runs as “assistant”, not a custodian)

## 5.3 Storage
- Postgres (core app)
- Redis (caches, rate limits)
- Off-chain object storage (Arweave / Shadow Drive / S3)
- Analytics warehouse (optional)

# 6) On-chain protocol specification (Anchor)

## 6.1 Canonical PDAs / seed conventions
All seeds are canonical and must be identical across program + SDKs.

```rust
CONFIG_SEED         = b"config"

VAULT_SEED          = b"vault"        + owner_pubkey + vault_id_le_u64
VAULT_AUTH_SEED     = b"vault_auth"   + vault_pubkey

BENEFICIARY_SEED    = b"beneficiary"  + vault_pubkey + beneficiary_pubkey
GUARDIAN_SEED       = b"guardian"     + vault_pubkey + guardian_pubkey

ASSET_RULE_SEED     = b"asset_rule"   + vault_pubkey + mint_pubkey

LIVENESS_DELEGATE_SEED = b"delegate"  + vault_pubkey + delegate_pubkey

UNLOCK_SEED         = b"unlock"       + vault_pubkey + nonce_le_u64
APPROVAL_SEED       = b"approval"     + unlock_pubkey + guardian_pubkey

DIST_SOL_SEED       = b"dist_sol"     + unlock_pubkey
DIST_SPL_SEED       = b"dist_spl"     + unlock_pubkey + mint_pubkey

DISPUTE_SEED        = b"dispute"      + unlock_pubkey

SUBSCRIPTION_SEED   = b"sub"          + vault_pubkey

GUARDIAN_PROFILE_SEED = b"g_profile"  + guardian_pubkey
GUARDIAN_BOND_SEED    = b"g_bond"     + guardian_pubkey
6.2 Program constants
Rust

BPS_DENOMINATOR: u16 = 10_000

MAX_LABEL_LEN: usize = 16
DOC_URI_MAX: usize = 200

// Hard caps to keep accounts bounded.
// NOTE: In full build, we use per-entry PDAs, so these caps are mostly UI-side.
MAX_BENEFICIARIES_HINT: u16 = 100

6.6 Remaining-accounts conventions (distribution batching)
Distribution must be compute-safe and therefore batched.

6.6.1 Beneficiary ordering
To avoid ambiguity, beneficiaries are processed in a deterministic sorted order:

Sort by beneficiary_pubkey ascending (bytes) off-chain.
The UI/automation worker must pass accounts in that order for each batch.
6.6.2 SOL distribution batching: execute_distribution_sol_batch(start_index, batch_size)
Remaining accounts list format (2 per beneficiary):

beneficiary_entry_i (PDA account; read-only)
beneficiary_wallet_i (system account; writable)
So remaining accounts length must be 2 * batch_size.

Batch payout computation:

For each beneficiary in batch:
pay_i = floor(distributable_sol * share_bps / 10_000) except last global beneficiary gets remainder.
Because batching makes “remainder to last beneficiary” tricky, we enforce:
SOL distribution can be either:
single-shot (recommended when beneficiaries <= ~20), or
batched with a DistributionSolSession state that tracks paid_total and a finalization step. Full build decision: implement DistributionSolSession for correctness at scale (omitted from structs above for brevity; add if you expect >20 beneficiaries). If you expect low counts, you may keep single-shot.
6.6.3 SPL distribution batching: execute_distribution_spl_batch(start_index, batch_size)
Remaining accounts list format (3 per beneficiary):

beneficiary_entry_i (PDA; read-only)
beneficiary_wallet_i (read-only)
beneficiary_ata_i for the given mint (writable)
So remaining accounts length must be 3 * batch_size.

Validation rules:

beneficiary_entry_i.vault == vault
beneficiary_entry_i.active == true
beneficiary_wallet_i.key == beneficiary_entry_i.beneficiary
beneficiary_ata_i must be the associated token account for (beneficiary_wallet_i, mint) (validate on-chain)
Progress:

DistributionSplSession.cursor advances by batch_size until full beneficiary list is processed.
When cursor reaches total active beneficiaries:
mark dist_spl.done = true
6.6.4 Finalization rule
finalize_unlock can only succeed if:

unlock status is Approved/Executing
unlock.sol_done == true (or SOL dist session finalized)
all required SPL mint sessions are done (off-chain can enforce by requiring list of sessions)
no dispute is open

unlock_sessions
approvals
distributions
disputes
Exposes derived state:
“unlock eligible at” timestamps per vault
“timelock ends at”
“next check-in deadline”
“risk alerts” (e.g., threshold too low)
7.3 Notifier service
Scheduled reminders:
upcoming check-in (T-7d, T-1d)
missed check-in
unlock eligible
unlock initiated
approvals requested
timelock ending soon
Channels:
email
SMS
push notifications (mobile)
optional wallet notifications
7.4 Document service
Client-side encryption:
derive symmetric key from user secret or wallet-based key agreement
never send plaintext to servers
Storage:
upload encrypted blob to Arweave/Shadow Drive/S3
On-chain:
store doc_hash (sha256) and doc_uri
Optional:
“signing ceremony” (owner + witnesses sign the hash off-chain; store signatures in doc metadata)
7.5 KYC / professional guardian
KYC results stored off-chain
On-chain GuardianProfile.kyc_level set by admin after verification
Guardian bond deposits held on-chain (bonding mechanism)
8) Data storage & schemas (product DB)
Postgres tables (minimum):

users (wallet, created_at)
vaults (vault_pubkey, owner_wallet, settings snapshot)
guardians (vault_pubkey, guardian_wallet, role, active)
beneficiaries (vault_pubkey, beneficiary_wallet, share_bps, active)
unlock_sessions (unlock_pubkey, vault_pubkey, nonce, status, timestamps)
approvals (unlock_pubkey, guardian_wallet, ts)
asset_rules (vault_pubkey, mint, mode, assigned_beneficiary)
documents (vault_pubkey, doc_hash, uri, version, created_at)
notifications (wallet, channels, schedules)
guardian_profiles (guardian_wallet, kyc_level, display info)
guardian_bonds (guardian_wallet, amount, locked)
9) Security & threat model (deep)
9.1 Threats and mitigations
Guardian collusion theft
Mitigations:
M-of-N threshold + timelock
owner override/cancel
dispute mechanism + arbiter
professional guardian bonding + slashing (optional)
strict event transparency for forensics
False positive unlock (owner alive, missed check-in)
Mitigations:
long inactivity threshold (90–180d typical)
multiple reminders (multi-channel)
timelock after approvals
owner can check-in + cancel during timelock
Phishing / UI compromise
Mitigations:
show transaction simulation and clear “this withdraws funds from vault” warnings
hardware wallet encouraged
allowlist official app origins
publish open-source tx builders
Program exploit / drain
Mitigations:
minimize privileged admin powers
pause switch
strict PDA signer checks
audits + fuzzing + invariants
separate upgrade authority behind multisig
Arbiter abuse (if disputes enabled)
Mitigations:
arbiter optional per vault (owner chooses)
arbiter actions timelocked or multi-sig (future)
transparent events and challenge process
10) Testing strategy
10.1 Protocol tests (Anchor)
PDA derivation tests
guardian/beneficiary add/remove, threshold checks
deposits/withdrawals blocked during unlocking/frozen
unlock initiation eligibility based on clock
approval uniqueness via GuardianApproval PDA
timelock enforcement
distribution batch correctness:
SPL ATA validation
correct pro-rata sums
cursor progression and idempotency
dispute transitions
10.2 Backend tests
indexer correctness: events → read model
notifier scheduling correctness
doc encryption/decryption roundtrip
transaction builder determinism (same inputs produce same tx)
10.3 End-to-end
scenario: create vault, deposit, set plan, check-in
wait simulated time: unlock eligible → approve → timelock → distribute → finalize
11) Deployment & operations
11.1 Environments
localnet (dev)
devnet (staging)
mainnet-beta (prod)
11.2 Key management
Upgrade authority behind multisig
Admin keys for:
pause
arbiter assignment
KYC-level updates (optional) Stored in hardware-backed KMS for production.
11.3 Observability
Index events
Alert on:
spikes in unlock initiations
repeated dispute openings
failed distributions (compute, missing ATAs)
suspicious guardian behavior (many approvals across many vaults)
12) Roadmap / execution plan (full product build)
Phase 0 — Research & spec hardening (2–3 weeks)
finalize state machine and batching design
decide subscription model and whether on-chain enforced
finalize dispute/arbitration approach (optional vs required)
Phase 1 — Protocol core (4–6 weeks)
implement vault creation, guardians, beneficiaries
deposits/withdrawals
liveness check-in + delegates
unlock session + approvals + timelock
SOL + SPL distribution (single-shot first, then batching)
event completeness + indexer schema
internal audit + fix pass
Phase 2 — Product apps (4–8 weeks parallel)
Next.js web app:
owner dashboard
guardian portal
beneficiary portal
transaction builder library (TS SDK)
indexer + read model
notifier (email/SMS)
docs encryption + upload service
Phase 3 — Safety + scale features (6–10 weeks)
full batching sessions for SOL + SPL
per-asset rules (AssignAll + ProRata shipped; custom splits later)
freeze/unfreeze + “panic mode” UX
dispute module (arbiter + resolution events)
Phase 4 — Professional guardians (6–12 weeks)
guardian profile registration
KYC pipeline integration
bonding contract and admin-set KYC levels
marketplace UX:
filtering (jurisdiction, language, fees)
request flow (off-chain contract + on-chain guardian entry)
reputation scoring (off-chain read model + on-chain attestations optional)
Phase 5 — Audits + beta (8–12 weeks)
third-party security audit(s)
bug bounty
staged mainnet rollout:
low limits
progressive feature enabling
wallet partnerships (embedded “Legacy” feature)
Phase 6 — Production scale (ongoing)
formal verification for critical distribution math
multi-program split if needed (marketplace module separated)
compliance posture improvements:
clearer legal doc workflows
jurisdiction-specific templates (off-chain)
enterprise offering:
exchanges/custodians “deceased account handling” integrations




Important implementation refinement (needed for provably-correct batching):
Your master design doc used per-entry PDAs for guardians/beneficiaries. That makes it hard to prove “no beneficiary was omitted” during chunked distribution without an on-chain canonical ordering.
Solution implemented here: add a VaultIndex PDA that stores the sorted list of active guardian pubkeys and beneficiary pubkeys. Distribution batches verify entries against this index, so missing/duplicated beneficiaries are rejected on-chain.
You should add a short note in the master doc under “Remaining-accounts conventions” that VaultIndex is canonical ordering.

Below is a complete monorepo scaffold (code) for:

indexer/ (TypeScript; RPC WS logs + optional Helius webhook ingestion; Anchor event decoding)
api/ (TypeScript; SIWS auth + tx-builder endpoints)
notifier/ (TypeScript; cron + email/SMS templates; Postgres/Redis-backed queues)
web/ (Next.js App Router; wallet adapter; SIWS sign-in; core flows)
docker-compose.yml (Postgres + Redis; plus services so docker compose up brings up the stack)
I’m basing:

the webhook receiver on Helius’ webhook payload model + auth header support. 
1
SIWS message format on Phantom’s “Sign-In-With standards” docs. 
2
the Anchor event decoding approach on Anchor’s TS EventCoder/event decoding interface. 
3
the Next.js Solana integration skeleton on Solana’s Next.js frontend docs. 
4
Assumption: your Anchor program is already deployed and you have an IDL JSON for legacyvault available at ./idl/legacyvault.json in the repo root (or you can generate it from Anchor and copy it there).

indexer/src/handlers/derivedState.ts — fully implemented mapping all Anchor events → Prisma derived state
api/src/routes/tx.ts — expanded to cover the entire protocol surface (vault/plan/liveness/unlock/dispute/distribution/subscription/pro-guardian/bonds)
web/src/app/vault/[vault]/page.tsx — a complete guided flow UI: setup plan → unlock → distribute
I’m also including two tiny integration patches that are required for these to actually run:

a patch to indexer/src/handlers/eventsToDb.ts so it calls applyDerivedStateFromEvents
a patch to api/src/routes/vaults.ts to add a /full endpoint (UI uses it)
1) indexer/src/handlers/derivedState.ts
This file assumes your Prisma schema includes Document and AssetRule models (recommended for a full build).
If you don’t have them yet, add them (schema snippet at top of file).

2) api/src/routes/tx.ts — expanded to cover entire protocol surface
This is a single file replacement. It:

validates input with zod
fetches on-chain state when needed (e.g., next unlock nonce, beneficiaries list)
builds unsigned tx base64 (sometimes with pre-instructions like ATA creation)
returns { txBase64, blockhash, lastValidBlockHeight, meta }

Patch: add /v1/vaults/:vault/full in API (needed by UI)
TypeScript

// api/src/routes/vaults.ts (add this handler)
vaultsRouter.get("/:vaultPubkey/full", requireAuth, async (req: any, res) => {
  const vault = await prisma.vault.findUnique({
    where: { vaultPubkey: req.params.vaultPubkey },
    include: {
      guardians: true,
      beneficiaries: true,
      unlockSessions: {
        orderBy: { createdAt: "desc" },
        include: { approvalsRows: true, distSol: true, distSpl: true, dispute: true }
      },
      subscriptions: true
    }
  });
  if (!vault) return res.status(404).json({ ok: false });
  if (vault.ownerWallet !== req.user.wallet) return res.status(403).json({ ok: false });
  res.json({ ok: true, vault });
});
What you should run next (so this works end-to-end)
Add the missing Prisma models (Document, AssetRule) if you want those derived updates to compile; then:
Bash

pnpm -C db prisma migrate dev
Boot stack:
Bash

docker compose up --build
Go to http://localhost:3000, connect wallet, sign in, open a vault route.
